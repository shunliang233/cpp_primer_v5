In the track seeding and following approach, track candidates are built from the initial seeds. One method implemented in ACTS, the Combinatorial Kalman Filter, uses the Kalman formalism. Originally developed for monitoring and steering mechanical systems, it can also be used to iteratively calculate a track estimate. After a set of track candidates has been assembled and filtered, an additional track fit is usually performed to extract the best estimate of the track. The Kalman formalism can also be used for this, with the addition of a smoothing step that has certain benefits. Other fit strategies exist, such as a global fit that minimizes the distances between track-sensor intersections and measurements on all sensors at the same time. One drawback of this method is the necessity to invert very large matrices, which is computationally expensive.
